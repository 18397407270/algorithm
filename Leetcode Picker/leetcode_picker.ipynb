    "## Stickers to Spell Word\n",
    "**Date**: 2018-6-4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: [691](https://leetcode.com/problems/stickers-to-spell-word/description/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detail**:\n",
    "\n",
    "　We are given N different types of stickers. Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "　You would like to spell out the given `target` string by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.\n",
    "\n",
    "　You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.\n",
    "\n",
    "　What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the `target`? If the task is impossible, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\"with\", \"example\", \"science\"], \"thehat\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "　We can use 2 \"with\" stickers, and 1 \"example\" sticker.\n",
    "After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target \"thehat\".\n",
    "　Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[\"notice\", \"possible\"], \"basicbasic\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "　We can't form the target \"basicbasic\" from cutting letters from the given stickers.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "　`stickers` has length in the range `[1, 50]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "　`stickers` consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).\n",
    "\n",
    "　`target` has length in the range `[1, 15]`, and consists of lowercase English letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "　In all test cases, all words were chosen randomly from the 1000 most common US English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.\n",
    "\n",
    "　The time limit may be more challenging than usual. It is expected that a 50 sticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average."
